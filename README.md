# Need to create an inverted index and after a console GUI
When we run the program, the console GUI will pop up and will prompt the user to either run(r) the program which will create the inverted index, search(s) from the inverted index already present or check(c) to see for duplicates. When you press s, another console GUI will pop up which will ask for the query to be searched.
